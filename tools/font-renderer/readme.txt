These instructions are for Windows only.

To use this script you have to install FontForge and ImageMagick.
Then you add FontForge and ImageMagick's installation folder
to your environment path

Once you have that completed you can 'cd' into the script directory,
type in "fontforge-console" and press Enter. This will allow you to 
use FontForge's built-in Python interpreter.
Then you can run the script by typing in "ffpython ttf2png.py" and 
hitting Enter. The script will prompt you to enter the filename of
a font (for now just use 'dpcomic.ttf') and then the font size.

If succesful it should start spitting out PNG files
from the test font 'DPComic' into a newly created "dpcomic" directory.

With the test completed you too can have the fun of exporting PNG files
from any given font.
